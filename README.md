# CodeChallenge
Challenge your programming skill. Credit to r/dailyprogrammer for all the challenges.

[easy] challenge #1
====================
create a program that will ask the users name, age, and reddit username. have it tell them the information back, in the format:

your name is (blank), you are (blank) years old, and your username is (blank)

for extra credit, have the program log this information in a file to be accessed later.

[easy] challenge #2
====================
Hello, coders! An important part of programming is being able to apply your programs, so your challenge for today is to create a calculator application that has use in your life. It might be an interest calculator, or it might be something that you can use in the classroom. For example, if you were in physics class, you might want to make a F = M * A calc.

EXTRA CREDIT: make the calculator have multiple functions! Not only should it be able to calculate F = M * A, but also A = F/M, and M = F/A!

[easy] challenge #3
====================
Write a function:
`public static int solution(int[] A)`
that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

For example, 

given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].
