# CodeChallenge
Challenge your programming skill. Credit to r/dailyprogrammer for all the challenges.

[easy] challenge #1
====================
create a program that will ask the users name, age, and reddit username. have it tell them the information back, in the format:

your name is (blank), you are (blank) years old, and your username is (blank)

for extra credit, have the program log this information in a file to be accessed later.

[easy] challenge #2
====================
Hello, coders! An important part of programming is being able to apply your programs, so your challenge for today is to create a calculator application that has use in your life. It might be an interest calculator, or it might be something that you can use in the classroom. For example, if you were in physics class, you might want to make a F = M * A calc.

EXTRA CREDIT: make the calculator have multiple functions! Not only should it be able to calculate F = M * A, but also A = F/M, and M = F/A!

[easy] challenge #3
====================
Write a function:
`public static int solution(int[] A)`
that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

For example, 

- given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
- Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
- Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].

[Intermediate] challenge #4
============================
You are climbing a stair case. It takes N steps to reach to the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given N will be a positive integer.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step


[Intermediate] challenge #5
============================
Find duplicate number

Given an array numbers containing n+1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Example:
- Input: [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]
Output: 2
- Input: [3, 1, 3, 4, 2]
Output: 3

[Intermediate] challenge #6
============================
Write a function solution that given an integer N, returns the maximum possible value obtained by inserting one '5' digit inside the decimal representation of integer N.

Example:
- Given N = 268, the function should return 5268.
- Given N = 670, the function should return 6750.
- Given N = 0, the function should return 50.
- Given N = -999, the function should return -5999.

Assume that:
- N is an integer within the range [-8000...8000]
